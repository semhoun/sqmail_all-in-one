## Settings for the Sieve interpreter
##

# Do not forget to enable the Sieve plugin in 15-lda.conf and 20-lmtp.conf
# by adding it to the respective mail_plugins { sieve = yes } settings.

# See https://doc.dovecot.org/latest/core/plugins/sieve.html

# Used by both the Sieve plugin and the ManageSieve protocol
# https://doc.dovecot.org/latest/core/plugins/sieve.html#script-storage-type-personal

# Which Sieve language extensions are available to users. By default, all
# supported extensions are available, except for deprecated extensions or
# those that are still under development. Some system administrators may want
# to disable certain Sieve extensions or enable those that are not available
# by default. This setting can use 'yes' and 'no' to specify differences relative
# to the default. For example `imapflags = yes' will enable the
# deprecated imapflags extension in addition to all extensions were already
# enabled by default.

# Which Sieve language extensions are ONLY available in global scripts. This
# can be used to restrict the use of certain Sieve extensions to administrator
# control, for instance when these extensions can cause security concerns.
# This setting has higher precedence than the `sieve_extensions' setting
# (above), meaning that the extensions enabled with this setting are never
# available to the user's personal script no matter what is specified for the
# `sieve_extensions' setting. The syntax of this setting is similar to the
# `sieve_extensions' setting, with the difference that extensions are
# enabled or disabled for exclusive use in global scripts. Currently, no
# extensions are marked as such by default.

# address parts introduced by the subaddress extension. This may
# also be a sequence of characters (e.g. '--'). The current

# left of the separator and the :detail part is right. This setting
# is also used by Dovecot's LMTP service.
